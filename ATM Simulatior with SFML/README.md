# ATM Simulator with C++ and SFML Graphics Library

This is a simple ATM simulator program written in C++ language. The program allows the user to simulate ATM operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, and transferring money between accounts. The program also includes a user login system and error handling for invalid inputs.

## SFML
SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) Graphics is a cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide a simple interface to various multimedia components such as graphics, audio, networking, and windowing system. It is written in C++ language and supports multiple programming languages including C, Python, and Java.

SFML Graphics provides a powerful set of features for 2D graphics rendering. Its API is object-oriented and designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy to create complex graphics applications with minimal effort. Some of the features provided by SFML Graphics include:

- Support for hardware-accelerated graphics rendering using OpenGL and Direct3D.
- Support for multiple window creation and management.
- Support for loading and displaying various image formats such as PNG, JPEG, and BMP.
- Support for drawing 2D shapes such as points, lines, rectangles, circles, and polygons.
- Support for text rendering and manipulation.
- Support for sprite sheets, animations, and transformations.
- Support for shader programs to create advanced graphics effects.

SFML Graphics is widely used in the game development industry due to its simplicity and performance. It is also used in other graphics-intensive applications such as simulations, visualizations, and user interfaces.
## Requirements
