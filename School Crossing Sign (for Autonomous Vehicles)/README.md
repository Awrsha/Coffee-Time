# School Crossing Sign (for Autonomous Vehicles)

This project demonstrates a simple computer vision-based system that detects school crossing signs using a camera feed and sends signals to an Arduino to trigger actions based on the detected signs. The setup is designed as a proof-of-concept for autonomous vehicles or driver-assistance systems, which could alert the vehicle or driver when a school crossing sign is detected.

## Overview
This project involves using a camera to monitor the road for school crossing signs. When a crossing sign is detected, the system:
- Highlights the detected sign on the video feed.
- Sends a signal to an Arduino board to perform an action (e.g., alerting the vehicle to slow down or stop).

The detection is performed using OpenCVâ€™s Haar Cascade Classifier, which processes each video frame to detect crossing signs in real-time.

## Project Structure
- **main.py**: The primary Python code that captures video, performs detection, and communicates with Arduino.
- **crossing.xml**: The Haar Cascade XML file for detecting school crossing signs.
- **README.md**: Documentation file.
- **Arduino Code**: Code to read signals from the computer and control outputs based on the signals.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino (or compatible microcontroller)
- Camera module (USB camera or NVIDIA Jetson onboard camera)
- Computer with a Python environment (NVIDIA Jetson is recommended for optimal video processing performance)
- LED or another indicator (optional, connected to the Arduino to test responses)

## Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (install using `pip install opencv-python`)
- PySerial (install using `pip install pyserial`)
- Arduino IDE for uploading code to the Arduino

## Setup Instructions
1. **Arduino Setup**:
   - Connect an LED or another indicator to pin 5 of the Arduino board.
   - Upload the Arduino code (see below) to the board.

2. **Python Environment Setup**:
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python pyserial
     ```
   - Place the `crossing.xml` file (Haar Cascade for crossing signs) in the project directory.

3. **Camera Setup**:
   - Use a compatible camera. For NVIDIA Jetson platforms, use the GStreamer pipeline for optimized performance, or adjust the camera source for other systems.

## Usage
1. Run the Python script to start capturing video and processing frames for school crossing signs.
   ```bash
   python final.py
   ```
2. Monitor the video output. If a crossing sign is detected, the bounding box will appear around it with the label "Crossing Sign".
3. The Arduino receives a signal and responds by controlling the connected LED or other indicators.

## Code Explanation

### Python Code (`final.py`)
The Python code captures the video stream, processes each frame to detect school crossing signs, and communicates with the Arduino over serial.

- **Video Capture**: Initializes the camera feed using OpenCV and GStreamer pipeline.
- **Detection**: Uses Haar Cascade to detect crossing signs. If a sign is detected, a bounding box is drawn.
- **Serial Communication**: Sends a signal ('a') to the Arduino when a crossing sign is detected. If no sign is detected, a continuous 't' signal is sent as a default state.

## Future Enhancements
- **Improved Detection**: Train a custom machine learning model for better accuracy in detecting crossing signs.
- **Multithreading**: Implement multithreading in Python to enhance video capture and processing speed.
- **Additional Indicators**: Integrate sounds or visual warnings to simulate a real autonomous vehicle response.
